## DORA Research Context

DORA data analysis from the 2016 and 2017 State of DevOps Reports shows teams achieve higher software delivery and operational performance (delivery speed, stability, and availability) when they: have three or fewer active branches, merge branches to trunk at least once a day, and have no code freezes or integration phases. Trunk-based development is a required practice for continuous integration.

# Trunk-Based Development

## Overview

Trunk-based development (TBD) is a branching strategy where all developers integrate to a single shared branch (trunk/main) at least once per day. Long-lived branches are the leading cause of merge pain, delayed feedback, and slow deployment cycles. Short-lived branches eliminate that waste.

## DORA Impact

| Metric | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Deployment Frequency | Main is always releasable; any commit can ship without a merge event |
| Lead Time for Changes | Integration happens daily instead of at sprint-end; feedback is immediate |

## When to Use

- Deciding a branching strategy for a new team or project
- Branches routinely live longer than 2–3 days
- Merge conflicts consume significant time before releases
- CI only runs on pull request creation, not continuously

## When NOT to Use

- Regulated environments that mandate a separate release branch for audit purposes (use a short-lived release branch cut from main, not a long-lived dev branch)
- Open-source projects with untrusted contributors (use forks, not long-lived branches)

## Core Pattern

**Before — long-lived feature branch:**

```
main:    A---B-----------------------M   ← merge commit, often conflicted
              \                     /
feature:        C--D--E--F--G--H--I      ← 2 weeks of divergence
```

By the time the feature branch merges, main has moved far away. The merge is a mini-project. CI on the branch tested stale code.

**After — trunk-based with short-lived branch:**

```
main:    A---B---C---D---E---F---G   ← deployable at every commit
                  \       /
branch:            b1---b2           ← lives < 1 day, merges before diverging
```

Each branch stays close to main. Conflicts surface immediately and are trivial.

**Breaking a large feature into trunk-safe increments:**

```
Week 1: merge data model (behind feature flag, flag OFF)
Week 2: merge API layer (flag still OFF, but integration-tested on main)
Week 3: merge UI (flag still OFF)
Week 4: enable flag for internal users → validate → enable for all
Week 5: remove flag, clean up dead code
```

The feature ships continuously; users only see it when it is ready. See the `feature-flags` skill for flag mechanics.

## Quick Reference

| Rule | Guidance |
|------|----------|
| Branch lifespan | Under 1 day; delete after merge |
| PR size | Small enough to review in under 30 minutes |
| Integration frequency | Merge to main at least once per day |
| Main branch | Always green; never commit broken code directly |
| Release branches | Cut from main when needed; never merge back to main |

**How to handle a feature too large for one day — use stacked PRs:**
1. Decompose into independently mergeable slices
2. Create branch `feat/slice-1` from main, implement, commit, push, open PR
3. Create branch `feat/slice-2` from `feat/slice-1` (not main), keep working
4. Each PR targets the previous branch; they merge bottom-up
5. Do not stop between slices — keep the momentum going
6. Guard incomplete slices with a feature flag if needed

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| "We do TBD but our branches live 1–2 weeks" | That is not TBD; it is gitflow without the labels | Enforce a 1-day branch age limit in team agreements |
| Merging main into a feature branch repeatedly | Symptom of a branch that has lived too long | Shorten the branch, not the merge cadence |
| Skipping feature flags for large features | Forces big-bang merge at the end | Introduce flags to decouple deploy from release |
| Only one developer integrating daily | Others still accumulate divergence | Every developer merges to main daily |
| Disabling CI on short-lived branches | Fast merges with broken code | CI must run on every push, even small branches |
